// Suppose I have a big paper and i want to draw n number of grids just by folding it (see example ). How many times do i have to fold it to get n number of grids. eg.

// n=1 , 0 operation, the original paper is one grid.

// n=2, 1 operations, i have to fold it 1 time to get 2 grids (A,B).

//  _______
// |   |   |
// | A | B |
// |   |   |
// |   |   |
// |___|___|
// No edge cases, all inputs are valid, But some built-in Math functions will have NO power here.

//Solution
let value = 1;
let exponent = 0;

while (value < target) {
    value *= base;
    exponent++;
}

if (value === target) {
    console.log(exponent); // 5
} else {
    console.log("Not a perfect power");
}
